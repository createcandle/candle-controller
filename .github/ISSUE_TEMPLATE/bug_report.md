**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is, and what you've attempted to fix the issue yourself.


**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error


**Your Candle Controller:**
 - Candle version: 2.0.0?

Etc


**Logs**
1. You can enable developer mode under the Candle App Store settings. After a reboot you can check out settings -> developer -> internal logs. You may also have to disable Privacy Manager's periodic deleting of these logs.
2. Plug your SD card into your computer and create a file called "generate_debug.txt" on it. Swap is back in, start the controller again, and wait a few minutes, then read the SD card in your computer again. It will now have a file called "debug.txt" that has everything needed to debug your controller.
